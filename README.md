# Object-Oriented-Programming
This is a brief version of Object Oriented Programming in Python.

1. This module begins with initiating a [Class and Object](https://github.com/danujs/Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/main/introOOP.py) program.
   Firstly, we need to add attributes to a class, and instantianting object. Then, we can add arguments (name and age). Finally, we create the object and call back the attributes of the   
   class.
